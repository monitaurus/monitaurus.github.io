### Appearance

> - Solarized ligth theme
> - Font: JetBrains Mono
> - Size: 14.0
> - Line: Height 1.3

I found light mode easier to have higher constrat without having a strange feeling of the color palette. I found this article ["Dark Mode vs. Light Mode: Which Is Better?"](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/dark-mode/) from Nielsen Norman Group a great read to break pre conceive ideas on the subject.

Mono fonts are great. Spaces between caracters make them easily predictable and then readable. As I use big enough screen, I increase the size of the font and the line height. The whole makes it comfortable for browsing code.

### Menu bar

> - Right bar for most used icon

The main idea for menu bar icons is to move the most used ones onto the right bar. So that when they're open or resized, they don't move the text with them, as they would if placed on the left bar. Here is my current organization:
